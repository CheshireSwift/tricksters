      Hey, you know how I'm working on an RPG setting where a miasma has settled upon the world causing misfortune, as
      the manifestation of trickster spirits doing shit to people? (the player characters are otherwise normal people
      who have concurrently with this acquired mild magic/super powers, and gained the ability to see the trickster
      spirits) (overall aiming for a heroes/antiheroes saving people from harm while working out wtf is going on vibe)
      There's quite a bit of overlap; several Jacks, several variations on hares/rabbits and foxes. Several variations
      on Wukong (who may be inspired by Hanuman, then you've got Monkey D. Luffy who seems named for him...) I'm aiming
      for one word names for each (which will allow deeper cuts on "hey, I get that one" and avoid being too on the
      noise/copyright-y), so thinking I might just have kind of a running joke where quite a few of them are called
      "Jack"? tbh having a bunch of them be called "Jack" feels like exactly the sort of bullshit trickster spirits
      would enjoy Angela Rachel heh Sam It's not really known to the players/definitely not known to the characters, but
      their powers come from having merged somewhat with a trickster spirit each. Could use animals for the
      "classes"/power bundles mechanically? Fox, Hare, Monkey. Maybe spider? Cunning, fast, disruptive, sneaky
      respectively.
