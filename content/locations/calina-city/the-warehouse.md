description = "Rotting concrete, rusting beams and broken windows. The warehouse sighs softly as a warm breeze pushes its way through. A group of... teenagers? twenty somethings? in mismatched clothing stand, lean and sprawl in a circle within, working out what the hell to do. To them, it's a base of operations. A space to breathe. A sanctuary."

## Sanctuary

The Warehouse is the place the crew underwent their transformation, and serves as their home base. It is a safe haven for them to rest, practice using their powers and store their possessions (ill-gotten or otherwise).

As a side-effect of their binding The Warehouse is shielded from tricksters: unless willingly shown the way by a mistbound, tricksters will wander around The Warehouse without ever realising it is there. Even if they attempt to follow one of the crew, they will somehow lose track of them as they approach the building. Unless the crew give other people cause to come looking for their hideout, the only other character that will show up is [Figaro](/characters/figaro)
