# Calina City

A city; large, but by no means a metropolis, in the midst of a languid late summer sunset. The shadows are long, and a dusty haze hangs over the streets, pale brown and spotted in orange as the streetlights start to flicker on.

## Demographics

Wealthy commodities traders along the waterfront. Smaller, middle class businesses as you move away from the river. A thick belt of factories and warehouses, mostly empty, housing squatter communities.

## Industry

A heavy industrial city. Back in the day the river brought materials down from the mountains and carried goods on to the coast. Now the waterfront is the home of big businesses and bars with prices to make your eyes water. The outer rings are where the factories and warehouses remain, though most are now shuttered, with many burnt out, graffitied or housing squatter communities.

## Infrastructure

Modern, functional, but undermaintained and suffering from a lack of investment.

## Architecture

Squat, industrial town. Red brick and concrete.
