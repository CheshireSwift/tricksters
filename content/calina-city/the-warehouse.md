# The Warehouse

Rotting concrete, rusting beams and broken windows. The warehouse sighs softly as a warm breeze pushes its way through. A group of... teenagers? twenty somethings? in mismatched clothing stand, lean and sprawl in a circle within, working out what the hell to do. To them, it's a base of operations. A space to breathe. A sanctuary.
